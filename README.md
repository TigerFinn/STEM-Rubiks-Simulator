# STEM-Rubiks-Simulator
High school project to simulate a Rubik's Cube. Code is not clean, and badly documented, but was a fun conceptual challenge.


#Cube.py is the equivelant of the main class.
* Interact with the cube using standard notations.
* *R ; Right face
* *L ; Left face
* *F ; Front face
* *B ; Back face
* *U ; Top (Upper) face
* *D ; Bottom (down) face
* *append ' ;anticlockwise turn
* *lower case ; turn face and middle
* *append 2 ; double turn
* *X,Y,Z ; turn cube on that access
* *solve; return cube to solved position
* * You can chain together any number of moves by a spaced sequence. e.g. "R U R' U'"

#Comments on code cleanliness
I made this project in the latter half of high school.
My biggest focus was understanding the digital representation of the cube. It is not well documented, and I spent a majority of the project time putting the piece rotations and positions into place. Each piece is represented individually, which is not the most efficient method, but was part of my aim for full representation of the cube.
